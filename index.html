                    Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level
                    programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
                    Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

                <p>
                    Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
                    Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords
                    frequently where as other languages use punctuation,
                    and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
                    specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
                    I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
                        You do not need to compile your program before executing it.
                        This is similar to PERL and PHP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
                        interpreter directly to write your programs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique
                        of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level
                        programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple
                        text processing to WWW browsers to games.
                    </li>

            <header>Hello World using Python</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a
                    small conventional Python Hello World program.
                </p>
                <code>
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </code>

        </section>
        <!-- VARIABLE TYPES -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Types">
            <header>Variable Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
                    This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.
                    Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
                </p>
                <h3>Assigning Values to Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.
                    The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.
                    The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value
                    stored in the variable. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    counter = 100 # An integer assignment<br>
                    miles = 1000.0 # A floating point<br>
                    name = "John" # A string
                </code>
                <h3>Standard Data Types</h3>
                <p>
                    The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is
                    stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations
                    possible on them and the storage method for each of them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Python has five standard data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers</li>
                    <li>String</li>
                    <li>List</li>
                    <li>Tuple</li>
                    <li>Dictionary</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Python Numbers</h3>
                <p>
                    Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    my_num = 12 <br>
                    my_float = 3.1416 <br>
                    my_num_two = 345
                </code>
                <h3>Python String</h3>
                <p>
                    Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.
                    Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes.
                    Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of
                    the string and working their way from -1 at the end.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    str = 'Hello World!'<br></br>
                    print str # Prints complete string<br>
                    print str[0] # Prints first character of the string<br>
                    print str[2:5] # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th<br>
                    print str[2:] # Prints string starting from 3rd character<br>
                    print str * 2 # Prints string two times<br>
                    print str + "TEST" # Prints concatenated string
                </code>
                <p>This will produce the following result:</p>
                <code>
                    Hello World!<br>
                    H<br>
                    llo<br>
                    llo World!<br>
                    Hello World!Hello World!<br>
                    Hello World!TEST
                </code>
                <h3>Python List</h3>
                <p>
                    Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas
                    and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent,
                    lists are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that
                    all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with
                    indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way
                    to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator,
                    and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]<br>
                    tiny_list = [123, 'john']<br></br>
                    print list # Prints complete list<br>
                    print list[0] # Prints first element of the list<br>
                    print list[1:3] # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd<br>
                    print list[2:] # Prints elements starting from 3rd element<br>
                    print tiny_list * 2 # Prints list two times<br>
                    print list + tiny_list # Prints concatenated lists
                </code>
                <p>This produce the following result</p>
                <code>
                    ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2]<br>
                    abcd<br>
                    [786, 2.23]<br>
                    [2.23, 'john', 70.2]<br>
                    [123, 'john', 123, 'john']<br>
                    ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2, 123, 'john']
                </code>
